### What I'll Have to Learn
I have never created a search or matching feature in ASP.NET MVC and will need to learn how to do so. In addition, I'll need to learn how to use Bootstrap and SQL server. I have also never used a third-party API before and will need to learn how to do so. BoardGameGeek.com uses XML, which I am unfamiliar with but their API will be a key component in my project.
